## Testing Scenario Summary

During the testing scenario, **I haven't found any bugs**. However, since no acceptance criteria were provided, I created a bug report to illustrate how I would define and document a bug. Below is an example bug report based on a hypothetical issue.

# BUG001 - EmployeeForm-Validation-Issue

## Summary:

On the Employee Form of the Bayzat employee management system, the **Preferred Name**, **First Name**, and **Last Name** fields do not have validation. Users can input numbers and even a single character into these fields, and the creation of the employee will still be successful, which is contrary to expected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to https://www.bayzat.com/
2. Login with the appropriate credentials.
3. Navigate to the "Company > All Employees" section from the sidebar menu.
4. Click on the "Add Employee" button.
5. Input a single character or numeric values into the **Preferred Name**, **First Name**, and **Last Name** fields.
6. Submit the form to create the employee.

## Actual Result:

-  The system allows the creation of an employee with invalid inputs (numeric values or single character) in the **Preferred Name**, **First Name**, and **Last Name** fields without any validation errors.

## Expected Result:

-  The system should validate the inputs for the **Preferred Name**, **First Name**, and **Last Name** fields to ensure they contain alphabetic characters only. If invalid inputs are detected, the form submission should be blocked and appropriate error messages should be displayed.

## Environment:

-  **Browser:** Chrome 127.0.6533.72
-  **Operating System:** Windows 11 v10.0.22632

## Severity/Priority:

-  **Severity: Medium**
   -  **Rationale:** The lack of validation on crucial input fields affects the data integrity of the employee records. While it does not prevent users from using the system, it can lead to inconsistent and unreliable data entries, which impacts the overall quality and usability of the system.
-  **Priority: Medium**
   -  **Rationale:** This issue should be addressed to ensure data integrity and improve the user experience. However, it can be prioritized after resolving more critical issues that directly impact core functionalities or system stability.
